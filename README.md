# 🩺 Pneumonia Detector - AI Powered Chest X-ray Classification App

This project is a deep learning-powered application that detects **Pneumonia** from chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the Kaggle Chest X-ray dataset. It comes with a user-friendly web interface built using **Streamlit**, allowing medical professionals or users to upload X-ray images and instantly receive a prediction.
